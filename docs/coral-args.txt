Command line options
Here are listed the options to CORAL. There are others, but they are disabled/not in use right now.

General Options
--inputCONS cons
Path condition to be solved (when using the command-line interface)

--solver solver
Solver to be used (when using the command-line interface). Choose between "PSO_OPT4J", "RANDOM" and "AVM". Default is "PSO_OPT4J".

--rangeLO lo
Lower bound of search interval. lo must be an integer. Default is -100.

--rangeHI hi
Upper bound of search interval. hi must be an integer. Default is 100.

--flexibleRange=boolean
Added support for "flexible" range inference. If enabled, the bounds of a variable can be bigger than the limits of the search interval (rangeLO/rangeHI). Ex:

  PC = x < 3000; range.HI = 100  
  range of 'x' with flexibleRange=false: [-100,100]
  range of 'x' with flexibleRange=true:  [-100,3000]
Default value is true.

--seed num
Seed to be used by the RNG. num must be a "long". Default value is 464655.

--radianSize num
Controls what values are used by the search when CORAL infers the domain of a variable as RADIAN. For more details, look here (section 4.2). Allowed values of num are '0' (smaller set of values) and '1' (bigger set). Default is '0'.

--degreeSize num
Controls what values are used by the search when CORAL infers the domain of a variable as DEGREE. For more details, look here (section 4.2). Allowed values of num are '0' (smaller set of values) and '1' (bigger set). Default is '0'.

--normValue max
Norm constant. Look here for details (section 4.1, "Fitness Functions"). Default is 100.

--showConcreteValues boolean
Show concrete value of symbolic variables in the output of SymLiteral.toString(). Default is 'false'.

--pcCanonicalization boolean
Canonicalize the query rewriting its variables. Ex:

AND(((1-$V12) <= 0),($V12 == $V14)) ==> AND(((1-$V1) <= 0),($V1 == $V2)) 
Default is 'true'.

Random Solver
--nIterationsRANDOM iter
Max number of generations executed by the random solver. iter must be an integer. Default is 360000.

PSO Solver
--nParticlesPSO num
Number of particles in the population created by the PSO solver. num must be an integer. Default is 55.

--nIterationsPSO iter
Max number of iterations executed by the PSO solver. iter must be an integer. Default is 600.

--perturbationPSO noise
Perturbation ratio used in the otimization process. noise must be an double. Default is 200.

--maxHit max
Max number of failed tentatives to solve one clause before incrementing its weight. max must be an integer. Default is 50.

--radianSearchLimit max
Max number of iterations using values from the selected fractions of pi for variables inferred as "RADIAN"). Default is 150.

--maxInsertedIndividuals max
Max number of individuals of previous runs or generated with help from interval solvers inserted in the population of a new search. Default is 10.

AVM Solver
--nIterationsAVM max
Max number of iterations executed by the AVM solver. max must be an integer. Default is 20000.

Interval Solver
--enableIntervalBasedSolver boolean
Seed the initial population and update the bounds of variables with the box reported by the interval solver. Default is 'false'.

--intervalSolver solver
Which interval-based solver you want to use. Allowed values for solver are 'realpaver' and 'icos'. Default is "realpaver".

--realPaverLocation path
Path to realPaver executable.

--icosLocation path
Path to icos-clp executable.

--icosArgs args
Arguments to be sent to ICOS. Default is "G=/tmp/icoslogs";

--simplifyUsingIntervalSolver boolean
Try to simplify the constraint using the box reported by the interval-based solver. Default is 'true'.

--intervalSolverPrecision precision
Precision used by the interval solver (1E-precision). precision must be an integer. Default is 3.

--intervalSolverTimeout timeout
Max time for the interval solver to answer the query (in ms). timeout must be an integer. Default is 2000.

Optimizations
--removeSimpleEqualities boolean
Use an equality decision procedure to simplify the constraint before calling a solver. Default is 'true'.

--toggleValueInference boolean
Infers ranges for the variables based on the context they appear. Default is 'true'

--reportTimeUnsolved boolean
Report average time spent on unsolved constraints. Default is 'false'.

--cacheSolutions flag
Cache solutions of previous queries. Default is 'false'
